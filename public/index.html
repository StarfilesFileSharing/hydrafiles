        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        <p>This site is part of the Hydrafiles network. It may be a mirror, a cdn, a storage server, just a gui, or all of the above.</p>

        <h2>What is Hydrafiles?</h2>
        <p>Hydrafiles is the web privacy layer, enabling anonymous hosting of both files and APIs. Anyone can host and serve static files or backends via HTTP without revealing their identity.</p>

        <h2>Why Hydrafiles?</h2>
        <p>In a world where information is freedom. We believe that the people have a right to access the world's information. We believe the people of Russia, China, Iran, America, North Korea, and the rest of the world, all deserve access to the same information. Most people don't use anti-censorship tools when they're inconvenient. We can't control the people. I personally wish the whole internet ran on I2P. But that's never going to happen because it's slow and inconvenient for users. Torrents died off because streaming is more convenient. Piracy is back because subscriptions have gotten inconvenient. Hydrafiles realises that the people don't want to trade their convenience for freedom. Unfortunately, not all hosts have the luxury. With global censorship of whistleblowing and propaganda at an all time high, it is, now more than ever, crucial for people to be able to anonymously serve files to the masses.</p>
        <p>P.s. Censored hosts that need Hydrafiles level security are likely also being censored in other ways. Please consider donating Monero to make this possible:</p>
        <pre>83BGShZv9hU9P9SRLjhRGJYQ4WatMNazKVFG6eKyHc6HguBzu1vH54R7mQJaZzeXhx4jDxnkNJMizLXrFFN4ARffEwFj82y</pre>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <img src="/download/04aa07009174edc6f03224f003a435bcdc9033d2c52348f3a35fbb342ea82f6f/c8fcb43d6e46" id="hydra-img1">
        <p>
        TLDR: This scene ^<br>
        P.s. This gif was served by Hydrafiles
        </p>
        <p>When someone requests a file or calls an endpoint, the request is sent to all peers. If a peer‚àÇ has the file or controls the requested endpoint, it will serve it. If not, it will forward the request to known peers and mirror the response. Because the request is forwarded by each peer and all peers mirror the response, it is impossible to tell which peer the response originated from. If no one has the file or controls the endpoint, the request will return a 404 once peers timeout.</p>

        <h2>What Hydrafiles isn't.</h2>
        <p>The Hydrafiles network does NOT provide privacy to the end user. Hydrafiles is designed to provide hosts privacy, not users. The peer you initially connect to can see exactly what you're doing. If you need to do something discretely, use TOR when accessing Hydrafiles. Hydrafiles itself does not hide content. All data on the Hydrafiles network can be seen by all peers. Sensitive content MUST be encrypted before submission to the network.</p>

        <h2>Who's in charge of Hydrafiles?</h2>
        <p>No one, anyone, everyone. Hydrafiles doesn't have a head. It's simply an API specification. Anyone can setup a domain, server, or S3 bucket, and add it to the network. The more people that decide to do this, the stronger the network.</p>

        <h2>How does Hydrafiles obscure where a file is being hosted?</h2>
        <p>When you call a Hydrafiles peer, if it's not hosting the requested content, it will check with other peers and pull the content from them. This means no matter which peer you ask, as long as one is serving the content, they all are.</p>

        <h2>Where is Hydrafiles?</h2>
        <p>Hydrafiles is everywhere. With the goal of being cross-border, we ask people like you to contribute to the movement, by setting up cross-border domains and servers.</p>

        <h2>Contribute to Hydrafiles</h2>
        <p>Because of Hydrafiles' layered approach, it is impossible to prove someones level of involvement in Hydrafiles. Domain providers may either be hosting their own servers, or pointing to other servers. Server providers may be hosting files, or may only be mirroring another providers files.</p>
        <p>To ensure resiliance, it is crucial to the protocol that servers and domains are evenly distributed between "unfriendly" states. This includes; <a href="https://alibabacloud.com">China</a>, <a href="https://yandex.cloud">Russia</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">America</a>, and <a href="https://www.arvancloud.ir">Iran</a>. As well as politically neutral countries such as <a href="https://njal.la">Sweden</a>. Ensure you aren't violating local laws when deciding on a region.</p>
        <h3 id="donate-domain">Donate a Domain or Subdomain (~$10/y or Free)</h3>
        <h4>1. Get a Domain</h4>
        <p>If you don't own a domain, you can use <a href="https://tld-list.com">TLD List</a> to find the sellers with the best price. If you'd like to buy the domain anonymously use <a href="https://njal.la">Njalla</a>. If you already have a domain, you can use it's subdomain for free</p>
        <h4>2. Configure Domain (Set DNS Record)</h4>
        <p>Once you have a domain or subdomain, find a reliable IP <a href="#directory">here</a>. Then set the following DNS record, replacing xxxx with the IP:</p>
        <code>A or AAAA = xxxx</code><br>
        <h4>2. Use CDN (Optional & Free)</h4>
        <p>We recommend using a CDN such as <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
        <p>CDNs cache files which makes download times faster and lowers server load. CDNs also add a layer between the Hydrafiles client you use and the public internet, forcing organizations to send requests to the CDN to find the IP.</p>
        <p><strong>If using Cloudflare</strong>, be sure to enable the "Cache Everything" rule.</p>
        <h3 id="donate-bandwidth">Donate Bandwidth (~$10/m+ or Free+Electricity)</h3>
        <h4>1. Get a Server</h4>
        <p><strong>Option A: Rent a server</strong>, we recommend <a href="https://sporestack.com">SporeStack</a> or <a href="https://njal.la">Njalla</a> as they don't ask for information.</p>
        <p><strong>Option B: Running your own server</strong> requires more maintenance, but improves decentralisation. To do this, get an old Mac, Windows, or Linux machine, even an RPI.</p>
        <h4>2. Connect to Hydrafiles</h4>
        <p><strong>Option A: Running a Node</strong> improves availability as your client talks to all peers instead of relying on just one. Your client also verifies that files haven't been tampered with before forwarding them.</p>
        <p>To run a full node, go to the <a href="https://github.com/StarfilesFileSharing/Hydrafiles">GitHub Repo</a> and follow the deploy instructions.</p>
        <p><strong>Option B: Running a Reverse Proxy</strong> is cheaper but less safe as file integrity can't be verified. It is not recommended to rely on a reverse-proxied peer as am exit point.</p>
        <h4>3. Announce Node (Optional)</h4>
        <p>When your client first starts, it attempts to announce itself to all known peers. A few hours after the client first starts, check other peers to ensure your client is known. If your client isn't known by other peers (or this one), you can announce your node <a href="#announce">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Donate Storage</h3>
        <p>To donate storage, you must first run a full node (see <a href="#donate-bandwidth">Donate Bandwidth</a>). This is crucial so storage providers and proxies can't be differentiated.</p>
        <h4>1. Local Caching (Optional)</h4>
        <p>When local caching is enabled, your client automatically stores a copy of the most popular files.</p>
        <p>In your <code>config.json</code> file, set the amount of storage you would like to donate. Whenever this limit is reached, unpopular files will be deleted.</p>
        <h4>2. S3 Bucket (Optional)</h4>
        <p>You can optionally configure an S3 bucket with your chosen S3 (compatible) provider.</p>
        <p>In your <code>config.json</code> file, set your S3 credentials. Ensure your S3 bucket is only accessible by your server for additional privacy.</p>
        <h3>I received a takedown notice, what do I do?</h3>
        <p>Follow the procedure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the file if you are hosting it and aren't legally allowed to host it.</li>
            <li>Forward the takedown notice to the Hydrafiles operator you received the file from.</li>
            <li>Respond to the requesting party with the following template:</li>
        </ol>
        <code style="background: none;">Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. We are not hosting any files. We are also unsure who is hosting your file(s). We have forwarded your message to related parties, but are unable to investigate any further. For more information, check <span class="hydra-host">example.com</span>. Thanks, your fellow Hydra operator.</code>

        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>This API is cross-compatible with all hostnames listed <a href="#directory">here</a> with HTTP enabled.</p>
        <p>For this example, we will be using a random hostname (<span class="hydra-host">https://hydrafiles.com</span>).</p>
        <h3>Download</h3>
        <p>Because of the distributed nature of Hydrafiles, it is crucial that you validate the sha256 checksum of the file you download.</p>
        <h3>Upload</h3>
        <p>Only storage donators can upload files to the network. To do so, run <a href="https://github.com/StarfilesFileSharing/Hydrafiles">this source code</a>, and add your file to the "files" directory with the filename being the sha256 checksum of the file.</p>
        <p>
        Method: <code>GET</code><br>
        Endpoint: <code><span class="hydra-host">https://hydrafiles.com</span>/download/<span style="background:#ccc;padding:2px 4px;border-radius:8px">sha256_checksum</span></code>
        </p>
        <h3>Signal-Strength Header</h3>
        <p>The <code>Signal-Strength</code> HTTP header is used to approximate number of hops without breaking privacy. This is used to approximate network other statistics such as redudancy.</p>
        <p>It works by simulating radio-wave interference. Nodes directly serving the file return a signal strength of 90%-100%. Each node after returns a signal strength 0-10% lower than the previous hop. If a node receives a signal strength of 95% or higher, it defaults to returning a signal strength of 90-100% to further obfuscate the origin.</p>
        <p>A simulation with 100k runs provides the following signal strengths:</p>

        <p>Hydrafiles domain and bandwidth donators are in the same legal territory as tor relay operators. They hide the real file host, while tor relays hide the real webserver. A browser extensionn or app that validates file hashes would be crucial.</p>

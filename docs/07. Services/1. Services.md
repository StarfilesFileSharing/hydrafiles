# Services

Hydrafiles services are dynamic API endpoints that are hostable & accessible via HTTP, WebRTC, and WebSockets. Hydrafiles allows peers to serve and receive content using any of (or a combination of) network protocols with the same data
availability. Services are also anonymous, with both the seeder and leacher's identity hidden.

## How does it work?

Hydrafiles uses Spartacus Routing for services. This is what provides privacy as well as allowing for all 3 connectivity options. The core differences to file routing are:

- Identifying entities by public key instead of checksum.
- Validating response with signature instead of checksum.

# Signed Requests

Peers can optionally sign requests sent to services. Signing a request allows you to verify the origin of a request. Use cases for this include authenticated or permission APIs, as well as monetisation.

## Integrating in Your Service

Your service should look something like this:
```ts
(req: Request) => {
  return new Response("Hello World!");
}
```

### 1. Require Signature
```ts
(req: Request) => {
  const signature = req.headers.get("hydra-signature");
  const from = req.headers.get("hydra-from");
  if (signature === null || from === null)
    return new Response("Request not signed");
  else
    return new Response("Hello World!");
}
```

### 2. Verify Signature
```ts
(req: Request) => {
  const signature = req.headers.get("hydra-signature");
  const from = req.headers.get("hydra-from");
  if (signature === null || from === null)
    return new Response("Request not signed");
  else if (!hydrafiles.rtcWallet.verifyMessage(JSON.stringify({ method: req.method, url: req.url, headers: req.headers }), signature, from))
    return new Response("Invalid signature");
  else
    return new Response("Hello World!");
}
```

### 3. Use Cases
Once a signature has been verified, you can treat `req.headers.get("hydra-from")` as the User ID for whitelisting, permissioning, etc. You can also check Ethereum Testnet for a transaction from the user.

# Executable

The Hydrafiles executable is a compiled version of the source code. There are binaries available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The Hydrafiles executable and library are identical, and have no exclusive features. The executable is the easiest way to run Hydrafiles, however the library is extendible if youÂ wish to use more advanced features.

### Option A: Run Compiled Binary

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/StarfilesFileSharing/hydrafiles/releases) and download the right executable.
2. Run it with `./hydrafiles`.

### Option B: Compile Binary

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarfilesFileSharing/Hydrafiles
cd Hydrafiles
deno task build
./build/start
```

### Option C: Build Docker Container

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarfilesFileSharing/Hydrafiles
cd Hydrafiles
docker build -t hydrafiles .
docker run -p 80:80 hydrafiles
```

### Option D: Run Deno

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarfilesFileSharing/Hydrafiles
cd Hydrafiles
deno task start
```

**If you intend to run this in production**, run as a service to ensure uptime.

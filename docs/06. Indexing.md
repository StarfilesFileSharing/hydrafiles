# Indexing

Hydrafiles allows for files in the network to be indexed (searchable).

Each peer keepsÂ a list of all files it knows about, identified by their hashes. Whenever a peer discovers (or adds) a file, it is added to their list.

File lists are exchanged between peers periodically. When a peer receives a file list, it will check for specific metadata/columns to add/replace for existing files, as well as new files to add to the list.

To know how to approximate the importance/relevance of a file, see "Hash Counting".

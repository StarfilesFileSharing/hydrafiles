# Payments

Hydrafiles has an, built in payment standard. Payments are optionally available in the network for a variety of functions which allows peers to monetise their activity. Because Hydrafiles is under heavy development, we use the Ethereum
Testnet, which allows us to simulate real transactions with fake money. When Hydrafiles is stable enough the network will be changed.

Payments are used in the network for a variety of functions. To ensure privacy isn't broken, each function has it's own Ethereum wallet (priv & pub key).

## Using Payments

When running a node, there is a chance another peer may pay you for a task for you to do or tip you for a task that you've already done. To opt in to payments, simply fund the Ethereum wallet of the functionality you'd like to pay for. If
you don't opt in to payments, your node can still receive payments from other peers. Your node will then spend the received money to pay other peers for the same task. It is recommended you **DONT** move funds between accounts or do any
other activities that can link them.

## Wallets:

- **filesWallet**: Used for "thank you" tip's when a file is transferred
- **rtcWallet**: Used for WebRTC signalling - **DO NOT FUND**
- **apiWallet[]**: Used for API routing, authentication, and payments

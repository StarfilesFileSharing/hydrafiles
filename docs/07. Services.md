# Services & Anonymous APIs

Hydrafiles v0.4.0 introduced reverse proxies. This allows clients to host HTTP APIs anonymously.

## How does it work?

This uses the same routing mechanism that Hydrafiles uses for serving static files. The core differences are:

- Instead of requesting via file hash, peer requests via endpoint's public key.
- Response checksum isn't validated, instead signature is validated.

## Instructions

### 1. Run Node

First run your node. Set a deriviation key or backup the randomly generated key on first run. This key is the private key that gives you ownership over the hostname.

### 2. Create hostname

Create a hostname and set the request handler:

```
const hostname = hydrafiles.services.addHostname((req: Request) => {
  console.log(req);
  return new Response("Hello World!");
});
console.log(hostname)
```

### 3. Test Hydrafiles Domain

Check any Hydrafiles node for your hostname. For example:

```
http://localhost/endpoint/GB4GKNSDGEZUIYTDGU2TMNZQGAZDQOBWGFSTQZBSHA4TCMZQMFCTIYJVGBQTANJYMEYA====
```

### 4. Announce Domain

Hydrafiles v0.10.0 introduced the Hydra Name Service (HNS). The HNS acts as a (decentralised) registry of Hydrafiles hostnames. Hostnames can be added with a PoW challenge.

You can announce your hostname to the registry like so:

```
hydrafiles.services.ownedServices[hostname].announce("Service Name");
```

### 5. Check HNS Registry

To search the HNS registry, simply check the HNS blockchain.

```
console.log(hydrafiles.nameService.blocks)
```

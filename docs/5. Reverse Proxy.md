# Using Hydrafiles as a Reverse Proxy ‐ Anonymous APIs
Hydrafiles v0.4.0 introduced reverse proxies. This allows clients to host HTTP APIs anonymously.

## How does it work?
This uses the same routing mechanism that Hydrafiles uses for serving static files. The core differences are:
- Instead of requesting via file hash, peer requests via endpoint's public key.
- Response checksum isn't validated, instead signature is validated.

## Instructions
### 1. Run Node
First run your node. Your node will automatically generate `public.key` & `private.key` files. Backup these as they prove ownership of your hostname.

### 2. Get Hostname
Your hostname is then displayed with each summary. Hostnames look like this:
```
9tpmjtjmenb7cqtdedwpctkrctwpyv9de57m6mju9mu64qtqa1gjuxv4c91k0xku6cupe.etm62bb4cwv30rbj9n83gjv6atcq2u9ddnjm8mvt9t25jqv4e557cjjadt3n6d3jb1n7e
```

### 3. Change Config (Optional)
Set `reverseProxy` in your config to the base URL of your endpoint (e.g. http://localhost:81) or set in JavaScript, set:
```
Hydrafiles.rpcServer.handleCustomRequest = (req) => {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

You can skip this step to test, a "Hello World!" will show by default.

### 4. Test Hydrafiles Domain
Check any Hydrafiles node for your hostname. For example:
```
http://localhost/endpoint/9tpmjtjmenb7cqtdedwpctkrctwpyv9de57m6mju9mu64qtqa1gjuxv4c91k0xku6cupe.etm62bb4cwv30rbj9n83gjv6atcq2u9ddnjm8mvt9t25jqv4e557cjjadt3n6d3jb1n7e
```

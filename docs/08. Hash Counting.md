# Hash Counting

The goal of hash counting is to allow peers to anonymously cast votes in a gossip network. This allows peers to rank files based on arbitrary factors the network believes are important.

## Where does Hydrafiles use hash counting?

Hydrafiles peers exchange lists of files. To boost the rank of a file, the peer can cast a vote for the file. The peer can choose when to cast a vote. For example on download.

## How does it work?

You can imagine a vote working like this:

```
const hash = hash(file)
const nonce = randomFloat()
const voteHash = hash(hash + nonce)
if (voteHash > lastVoteHash) {
    save(hash, nonce)
    announce(hash, nonce)
}
```

Other peers then receive a copy of the file's nonce, and if the nonce is higher than the saved nonce, the new nonce will be saved.

To fix diminishing returns after a lot of hashes have been generated, we can implement a "rank by 2nd best vote nonce" rule for example or add expiry's.

## When/Why do peers vote?

Peers can vote for files they believe are important at any time and as many times as they want. This allows us to rank files based on what the network believes is important.

# Signal-Strength Header

The `Signal-Strength` response header is used to approximate number of hops without breaking privacy. This is used to approximate network other statistics such as redudancy.

It works by simulating radio-wave interference. Nodes directly serving the file return a signal strength of 90%-100%. Each node after returns a signal strength 0-10% lower than the previous hop. If a node receives a signal strength of 95%
or higher, it defaults to returning a signal strength of 90-100% to further obfuscate the origin.

A simulation with 100k runs provides the following signal strengths:

| Hop # | Minimum | Average | Median | Maximum |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| 1     | 90      | 95      | 95     | 100     |
| 2     | 81      | 92      | 92     | 100     |
| 3     | 73      | 88      | 88     | 100     |
| 4     | 66      | 85      | 84     | 100     |
| 5     | 61      | 81      | 80     | 100     |
| 6     | 56      | 78      | 77     | 100     |
| 7     | 51      | 74      | 73     | 100     |
| 8     | 49      | 71      | 70     | 100     |
| 9     | 45      | 68      | 67     | 100     |
| 10    | 43      | 65      | 64     | 100     |

Based on these averages, we can correlate signal strength with number of hops.
